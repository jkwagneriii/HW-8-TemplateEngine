# HW-8-TemplateEngine
This is a homework assignment for the Northwestern University Coding Program. This assignment will utilize node.js to generate an html file. 

This app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

When you run the app.js in your terminal, you will be asked to supply some employee information. Make sure that each role on the team is filled, of course if you need a full team of interns feel free to add them in. Once all of your production team information has been submitted, a nicely formatted HTML document will render into the output folder. From there you can open the document in your browser and get started on the next team project!

This assignment ended up being relatively simple, but it took a lot of focus and attention to know what functions to be creating. Working from the test files is becoming clearer and clearer, but at first glance it looks like a bunch of wild information.
